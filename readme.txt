Pseudo-Range:
The pseudo-range (PR) is the distance from the receiver antenna to the satellite antenna including receiver and satellite clock offsets (and other biases, such as atmospheric delays): 
PR = distance + c * (receiver clock offset –satellite clock offset + other biases) 
so that the pseudo-range reflects the actual behaviour of the receiver and satellite clocks. The pseudo-range is stored in units of meters.

Pseudorange definition
The pseudorange (code) measurement is defined to be equivalent to the difference of the time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the receiver) and the time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the satellite) of a distinct satellite signal.
